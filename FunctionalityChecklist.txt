Functionality Checklist
1. Reading and saving
    - Loads mission data from data.csv when the program starts
    - Writes updated data back to data.csv only if something was changed
    - Output format matches the original CSV (including astronaut info)

2. Viewing missions
    - Shows all missions
    - Can filter to show only manned or only unmanned missions
    - Can view astronauts assigned to a specific mission

3. Adding and editing
    - User can add a new mission with all required details
    - Up to 5 astronauts can be added to a manned mission
    - Existing mission fields (e.g. name, code, destination, year, etc.) can be edited
    - If a mission is changed to unmanned, astronauts are automatically removed

4. Astronaut filtering
    - User can search for astronauts by nationality
    - Shows matching astronaut name, role, age, and what mission they belong to

5. Summary/statistics
    - Program can display the average success rate of all missions
    - Also shows which mission had the highest and lowest success rate

6. Input checking
    - All inputs are validated (e.g. launch year range, success rate limits, empty strings)
    - Handles invalid inputs (like typing letters instead of numbers) without crashing
    - User is asked to re-enter values until valid input is given

7. Menu and overall
    - Main menu displays all options and loops until exit
    - User can exit cleanly after saving
    - Program structure follows what was taught (separate Main, Controller, Mission, Astronaut classes)
